# Assignment: Class Communication: Slack and Piazza

Slack and Piazza are not open source tools but they are tools of communication we will use in this class to communicate. 
- Slack is a more general discussion-like forum for chatting about the class. Its use will be for informal chatting and getting more rapid access to peers and the instructor for help with assignments, lectures, or other class items.
- Piazza is a more structured forum for asking questions and curating answers with rich interaction. Piazza is great for bringing attention to common issues or gotchas with assignments, software, etc., that multiple students will benefit from seeing. When issues like this come up in slack they are not always easy for others to follow so organizing moderated Q&A in Piazza is helpful.
